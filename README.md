## Overview

This repository contains the source code of my personal website hosted on **GitHub Pages**.

The website functions as a public space for mathematical exposition, technical writing, and quantitative thinking. It combines academic-style presentation with modern web simplicity.

Its primary objective is to document ideas clearly and build a structured record of intellectual work over time.

## Main Section

### The Mathematical Workshop

**The Mathematical Workshop** is a recurring series dedicated to mathematical problem solving.

Each article focuses on one problem and emphasizes:

- clarity of reasoning,
- mathematical intuition,
- rigorous proofs,
- transferable ideas.

The aim is not only to solve problems, but to explain *why* the solution works.

## Content

The website includes:

- Mathematical problem solutions
- Notes on probability and stochastic reasoning
- Quantitative and analytical reflections
- Technical exposition written for clarity and precision

---

## Technology Stack

This website is built using a lightweight static architecture:

- **GitHub Pages** for hosting
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript**
- **MathJax** for LaTeX equation rendering

Advantages of this approach:

- fast loading
- version controlled content
- long-term reproducibility
- minimal dependencies

## Philosophy

Clear thinking deserves clear presentation.

Publishing work publicly encourages discipline, transparency, and continuous improvement. This website is intended to evolve as an open mathematical notebook.
